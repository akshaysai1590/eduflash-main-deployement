Task: Upgrade the EduFlash app with the following features. Make changes in a new git branch named `feature/fullstack-upgrades`. Commit each logical change with clear messages. Do not push to remote. After changes, list the files created/modified and show the git status.

Project layout:
- backend/server.js
- frontend/index.html
- frontend/script.js
- frontend/*.css (create if needed)
- README.md

Features to add (implement with safe defaults and placeholders for API keys):

1) Scoring & Progress
- Add score tracking in the frontend (session only, use localStorage to persist score and rounds).
- Add UI elements showing current score and rounds completed.
- Expose endpoints in backend if helpful (optional) to save progress locally (no DB).

2) Multiple Topics
- Add a simple topic selector UI (e.g., General, Math, Science).
- Store separate question banks in `backend/questions/*.json` (one per topic) and modify `/api/question` to accept `?topic=math` (default `general`).

3) AI-based Explanations (safe)
- Add an `EXPLAIN_PROVIDER` abstraction in backend that:
  - If env var `HF_KEY` or `OPENAI_KEY` exists, calls the provider with low token limits and returns the result.
  - If no key present or provider errors, return the canned explanation from the question bank.
- Ensure **caching**: store generated explanations in an in-memory cache (simple object keyed by `questionId`) for the process lifetime to avoid repeated API calls.

4) Leaderboard scaffold (Firebase-ready)
- Add a backend endpoint `/api/leaderboard` that accepts `POST { name, score }` to save scores and `GET` to list top scores.
- Implement the storage as a pluggable module:
  - Default implementation: in-memory array (non-persistent) and returns top 10.
  - Add a `services/leaderboard.firebase.js` file that contains instructions and placeholder code to integrate Firebase Realtime DB or Firestore. Do NOT include real credentials — instead, read `FIREBASE_CONFIG` from env or `backend/.env.example`.
- Add frontend UI to submit name and show top-10 leaderboard using `/api/leaderboard`.

5) Timer for each question
- Add an optional countdown timer (e.g., 30 seconds) in frontend per question with visible progress bar.
- When timer expires, auto-mark as wrong and show explanation button.

6) Branding & UI polish
- Add simple CSS (create `frontend/style.css`) with team/hackathon header, logo placeholder, nicer buttons, and micro-animations for correct/wrong (CSS transitions).
- Make the app mobile responsive.

7) README & Demo Script
- Update `README.md` with run, deploy, and env var instructions:
  - How to run locally (Replit), how to set `HF_KEY` / `OPENAI_KEY` / `FIREBASE_CONFIG`.
  - How to deploy frontend to Vercel (root=frontend).
  - Short 1-minute demo script and features list.
- Add a top-level `docs/` folder containing a 1-paragraph architecture summary and instructions to set up Firebase (copy/paste commands for Firebase CLI).

8) Git workflow & safety
- Create branch `feature/fullstack-upgrades`.
- Make commits with descriptive messages for each feature group (e.g., `feat: add topic selector and question banks`, `feat: add scoring & timer`, `chore: add README and docs`).
- Do NOT commit any secrets. Create `backend/.env.example` listing env vars: `HF_KEY`, `OPENAI_KEY`, `FIREBASE_CONFIG`.
- After finishing, run `git status` and show a short summary of changes and exact commit hashes.

Testing & quality:
- Add minimal input validation for endpoints.
- Ensure CORS remains enabled.
- Ensure frontend falls back gracefully if backend calls fail.
- Add console logs for key actions (QA use).

Finally: After making changes, output:
- `git branch --show-current`
- `git log -n 5 --oneline --decorate`
- `git status --porcelain`
- A short list of modified/created files.

If anything fails or you need me to refine behavior (e.g., specific leaderboard DB), I will iterate.

End of prompt.
